## What client sources do we leak?
We try our best to only leak clients that are skidded, cheat clients, or clients with idiotic owners or staff members.

## How do I leak clients?
It mainly depends on what type of client you're trying to leak, if it's a Forge Mod and obfuscated you'll need to deobfuscate it and remap it as well. If it's a MCP Client (Most common for shitty pvp clients) all you need to do is deobfuscate it (If it has obfuscation, in many cases skidders will use superblaubeere obfuscation which can easily be deobfuscated with Java-Deobfuscator, a free and open source tool).
